// This file is used to import and export all assets (images, fonts, etc.)

// Example:
// export const logo = require('./logo.png');

// After defining assets here, you can import them in your components like this:
// import { logo } from '../assets';

// Currently, there are no assets defined. Add your assets in this directory and export them in this file.
